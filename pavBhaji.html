        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <strong>Using a pressure cooker or instant pot</strong>
            <li>Pour 2 cups of water to the bottom of your cooker or pot.
                Then put in the stand that came with your cooker/pot</li>
            <li>Add potatoes, cauliflowers, carrots and peas to a 
                metal bowl or pressure cooker/pot safe container and cover with water. Put the 
                container into the cooker and secure the lid. Note: if using an 
                instant pot, remember to turn lid knob to "Sealing".</li>
            <li>On an instant pot, you can just press the Rice button, or 
                cook on high pressure for 12 minutes. For a pressure cooker, 
                turn off the heat after 2 whistles. For a non-whistling pressure 
                cooker, turn off the heat after 10 mins of it releasing steam. 
            </li>
            <strong>Using a Pot</strong>
            <li>If using a pot, then add the potatoes, cauliflower, peas 
                and carrots to the pot, pour water until 1 inch over the vegetables,
                cover and cook on medium heat for 10 minutes or until soft. Then 
                keep 1 cup of water with the vegetables, and remove any excess 
                (there should not be much excess).</li>
            <strong>Gravy base</strong>
            <li>Heat oil in pan on medium heat. When hot, add cumin and coriander seeds.</li>
            <li>When spices have released their fragrance, add onions, ginger-garlic paste, 
                and cook until onions have softened and started to brown.</li>
            <li>Add the cilantro stems and tomatoes and cook down until the mixture in the pan has started to 
                separate from the oil.</li>
            <li>Once separated, add the powdered spices as well as the Pav Bhaji Masala, and 
                another pinch of salt to taste. Then, quickly add the cup of vegetable water to 
                the mixture and stir well.</li>
            <li>Once everything is mixed, add the vegetables and mash it together until a chunky
                gravy has formed. Then add the bell pepper and the kasoori methi and cook for 
                3-5 more minutes.</li>
            <strong>Pav or Bread</strong>
            <li>In a separate pan, melt some butter on the pan, and put half a bun 
                down in the pan. Flip over when browned and toasted to toast the 
                other side.</li>
            <li>Serve as an open sandwich with some raw diced onion and cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
